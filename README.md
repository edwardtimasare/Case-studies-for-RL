The report details the application of a deep Q-learning algorithm to train convolutional neural networks (CNN) for playing the game Pong. 
This algorithm processes raw pixel data as input and outputs a value function that predicts future rewards. 
The findings indicate that the neural networks achieve human-like performance in Pong, surpassing random play significantly and highlighting the potential of deep Q-learning in handling complex Reinforcement Learning challenges.
